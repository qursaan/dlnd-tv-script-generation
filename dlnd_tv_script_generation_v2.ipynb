    "**Answer:** \n",
    "1. **Optimizer Hyperparameters** \n",
    "  * **Learning rate**: Good starting point from 0.01, The **0.001** was very good to avoid fast learning and show smooth loss,  I increase it a little bit to **0.002** to speed up process but it show a bounce values.\n",
    "  * **Minibatch size**: Too small is too slow learning and increase noise, Too large could be computationally taxing and could result in worse accuracy, best values from \\[32, 64, 128, 256\\]. In this test, I decide to use **128** as I able to use GPU and the text recognition problem may contain a lot of noise.\n",
    "  * **The number of Training Iterations (Epochs)**: I use **20** as its a test model and I can early stop model in case model produce a reasonable result.\n",
    "2. **Model Hyperparameters**\n",
    "  * **The number of layers (Hidden units)**: very important hyperparameter. n_layers is between 1-3. I choose 2 to be avoid overfitting and simplify the model calculations.\n",
    "  * **Model Specific Hyperparameters**:\n",
    "    1. **Embedding Dimension**: I decided to use a dimension power of 2. So, I choose **256** the first power of 2 higher than best range (Google query: show embedding size best to match the size of the unique vocab size).\n",
    "    2. **Hidden Dimension**: I use 128, the half of the embedding dimension layer, **512** double of embedding but wasn't improve result, and **256** with same as embedding.\n",
    "    3. **Sequence Length**:  I think the good value should be the same as the average sentence length of the dataset. I try a sequence length of **30** (epoch 10: 3.3), **16** (epoch 5: 3.9), and **20** (epoch 19: 3.8).\n",
